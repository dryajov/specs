## Overview

The circuit relay is a means of establishing connectivity between libp2p nodes (such as IPFS) that wouldn't otherwise be able to connect to each other.

This helps in situations where nodes are behind NAT or reverse proxies, or simply don't support the same transports (e.g. go-ipfs vs. browser-ipfs). libp2p already has modules for NAT ([go-libp2p-nat](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-nat)), but these don't always do the job, just because NAT traversal is complicated. That's why it's useful to have a simple relay protocol.

Unlike a transparent **tunnel**, where a libp2p peer would just proxy a communication stream to a destination (the destination being unaware of the original source), a circuit-relay makes the destination aware of the original source and the circuit followed to establish communication between the two. This provides the destination side with full knowledge of the circuit which, if needed, could be rebuilt in the opposite direction.

Apart from that, this relayed connection behaves just like a regular connection would, but over an existing swarm stream with another peer (instead of e.g. TCP.): One node asks a relay node to connect to another node on its behalf. The relay node shortcircuits its streams to the two nodes, and they are then connected through the relay.

Relayed connections are end-to-end encrypted just like regular connections.

The circuit relay is both a tunneled transport and a mounted swarm protocol.
The transport is the means of ***establishing*** and ***accepting*** connections, and the swarm protocol is the means to ***relaying*** connections.

Note: we're using the `/p2p` multiaddr protocol instead of `/ipfs` in this document. `/ipfs` is currently the canonical way of addressing a libp2p or IPFS node, but given the growing non-IPFS usage of libp2p, we'll migrate to using `/p2p`.

Note: at the moment we're not including a mechanism for discovering relay nodes. For the time being, they should be configured statically.

## Dramatization

Cast:
- QmOne, the dialing node (browser).
- QmTwo, the listening node (go-ipfs).
- QmRelay, a node which speaks the circuit relay protocol (go-ipfs or js-ipfs).

Scene 1:
- QmOne wants to connect to QmTwo,
  and through peer routing has acquired a set of addresses of QmTwo.
- QmTwo doesn't support any of the transports used by QmOne.
- Awkward silence.

Scene 2:
- All three nodes have learned to speak the `/ipfs/relay/circuit` protocol.
- QmRelay is configured to allow relaying connections between other nodes.
- QmOne is configured to use QmRelay for relaying.
- QmOne automatically added `/p2p-circuit/ipfs/QmTwo` to its set of QmTwo addresses.
- QmOne tries to connect via relaying, because it shares this transport with QmTwo.
- A lively and prolonged dialogue ensues.

## Addressing

`/p2p-circuit` multiaddrs don't carry any meaning of their own. They need to encapsulate a `/p2p` address, or be encapsulated in a `/p2p` address, or both.

As with all other multiaddrs, encapsulation of different protocols determines which metaphorical tubes to connect to each other.

A `/p2p-circuit` circuit address, is formated following:

`/p2p-circuit[<relay peer multiaddr>]<destination peer multiaddr>`

This opens the room for multiple hop relay, where the first relay is encapsulated in the seconf relay multiaddr, such as:

`/p2p-circuit/p2p-circuit/<first relay>/<first hop multiaddr>/<destination peer multiaddr>`

A few examples:

Using any relay available:

- `/p2p-circuit/p2p/QmTwo`
  - Dial QmTwo, through any available relay node (or find one node that can relay).
  - The relay node will use peer routing to find an address for QmTwo if it doesn't have a direct connection.
- `/p2p-circuit/ip4/../tcp/../p2p/QmTwo`
  - Dial QmTwo, through any available relay node,
    but force the relay node to use the encapsulated `/ip4` multiaddr for connecting to QmTwo.
  - We'll probably not support forced addresses for now, just because it's complicated.

Specify a relay:

- `/p2p-circuit/p2p/QmRelay/p2p/QmTwo`
  - Dial QmTwo, through QmRelay.
  - Use peer routing to find an address for QmRelay.
  - The relay node will also use peer routing, to find an address for QmTwo.
- `/p2p-circuit/ip4/../tcp/../p2p/QmRelay/p2p/QmTwo`
  - Dial QmTwo, through QmRelay.
  - Includes info for connecting to QmRelay.
  - The relay node will use peer routing to find an address for QmTwo.

Double relay:

- `/p2p-circuit/p2p/QmTwo/p2p-circuit/p2p/QmThree`
  - Dial QmThree, through a relayed connection to QmTwo.
  - The relay nodes will use peer routing to find an address for QmTwo and QmThree.
  - We'll probably not support nested relayed connections for now, there are edge cases to think of.

?? I don't understand the usage of the following:

- `/ip4/../tcp/../p2p/QmRelay/p2p-circuit`
  - Listen for connections relayed through QmRelay.
  - Includes info for connecting to QmRelay.
  - Also makes QmRelay available for relayed dialing, based on how listeners currently relate to dialers.
- `/p2p/QmRelay/p2p-circuit`
  - Same as previous example, but use peer routing to find an address for QmRelay.

?? I believe we don't need this one:
- `/p2p-circuit`
  - Use relay discovery to find a suitable relay node. (Neither specified nor implemented.)
  - Listen for relayed connections.
  - Dial through the discovered relay node for any `/p2p-circuit` multiaddr.

TODO: figure out forced addresses. -> what is forced addresses?

## Wire format

### Overview

#### Setup

Peers involved:
- A, B, R
- A wants to connect to B, but needs to relay through R

#### Assumptions

A has connection to R, R has connection to B

#### Process

- A opens new stream `sAR` to R using protocol RELAY
- A writes Bs multiaddr `/ipfs/QmB` on `sAR`
- R receives stream `sAR` and reads `/ipfs/QmB` from it.
- R opens a new stream `sRB` to B using protocol RELAY
- R writes `/ipfs/QmB` on `sRB`
- B receives stream `sRB` and reads `/ipfs/QmB` from it.
- B sees that the multiaddr it read is its own and chooses to handle this stream as an endpoint instead of attempting to relay further
- TODO: step for R to send back status code to A
- R now pipes `sAR` and `sRB` together
- TODO: step for B to send back status code to A
- B passes stream to `NewConnHandler` to be handled like any other new incoming connection

### Under the microscope

Peer A wants to connect to peer B through peer R.

`maddrA` is peer A's multiaddr
`maddrR` is peer R's multiaddr
`maddrB` is peer B's multiaddr
`maxAddrLen` is arbitrarily 1024

#### Function definitions
##### Process for reading a multiaddr
We define `readLpMaddr` to be the following:

Read a Uvarint `V` from the stream. If the value is higher
than `maxAddrLen`, (write an error message back?) close the 
stream and halt the relay attempt.

Then read `V` bytes from the stream and checks if its a valid multiaddr.
If it is not a valid multiaddr (write an error back?) close the stream and return.

#### Opening a relay
Peer A opens a new stream to R on the 'hop' protocol and writes:
```
<uvarint len(maddrA)><madddrA><uvarint len(maddrB)><madddrB>
```

It then waits for a response in the form of:
```
<uvarint error code><uvarint msglength><message>
```

Once it receives that, it checks if the status code is `OK`. If it is, it passes the new connection to its `NewConnHandler`.
Otherwise, it returns the error message to the caller.

### 'hop' protocol handler

Peer R receives a new stream on the 'hop' protocol.
It then calls `readLpMaddr` twice. The first value is `<src>` and the second is `<dst>`.
Peer R checks to make sure that `<src>` matches the remote peer of the stream its reading
from. If it does not match, it (writes an error back?) closes the stream and halts the relay attempt.

Peer R checks if `<dst>` refers to itself, if it does, it (writes an error back?) closes the stream and halts the relay attempt.
Peer R then checks if it has an open connection to the peer specified by `<dst>`.
If it does not, and the relay is not an "active" relay it (writes an error back) closes the stream, and halts the relay attempt.
If R does not have a connection to `<dst>`, and it *is* an "active" relay, it attempts to connect to `<dst>`.
If this connection succeeds it continues, otherwise it (writes back an error) closes the stream, and halts the relay attempt.
R now opens a new stream to B with the 'stop' relay protocol ID, and writes:
```
<uvarint len(maddrA)><madddrA><uvarint len(maddrB)><madddrB>
```

After this, R simply pipes the stream from A and the stream it opened to B together. R's job is complete.

### 'stop' protocol handler

Peer B receives a new stream on the 'stop' protocol. It then calls `readLpMaddr` twice on this stream.
The first value is `<src>` and the second value is `<dst>`. Any error from those calls should be written back accordingly.

B now verifies that `<dst>` matches its peer ID. It then also checks that `<src>` is valid. It uses src as the
'remote addr' of the new 'incoming relay connection' it will create.

Peer B now writes back a message of the form:
```
<uvarint 'OK'><uvarint len(msg)><string "OK">
```

And passes the relayed connection into its `NewConnHandler`.

### Error table

This is a table of error codes and sample messages that may occur during a relay setup. Codes in the 200 range are returned by the relay node. Codes in the 300 range are returned by the destination node.


| Code  | Message           | Meaning    |
| ----- |:-----------------:|:----------:|
| 100   | OK                      | Relay was setup correctly    |
| 220   | "src address too long"  | |
| 221   | "dst address too long"  | |
| 250   | "failed to parse src addr: no such protocol ipfs" | The `<src>` multiaddr in the header was invalid |
| 251   | "failed to parse dst addr: no such protocol ipfs" | The `<dst>` multiaddr in the header was invalid |
| 260   | "passive relay has no connection to dst" | |
| 261   | "active relay could not connect to dst: connection refused" | relay could not form new connection to target peer |
| 262   | "could not open new stream to dst: BAD ERROR" | relay has connection to dst, but failed to open a new stream |
| 270   | "<dst> does not support relay" | |
| 280   | "can't relay to itself" | The relay got its own address as destination|
| 320   | "src address too long" | |
| 321   | "dst address too long" | |
| 350   | "failed to parse src addr: no such protocol ifps" | The `<src>` multiaddr in the header was invalid |
| 351   | "failed to parse dst addr: no such protocol ifps" | The `<dst>` multiaddr in the header was invalid |

## Interfaces

As explained above, the relay is both a transport (`tpt.Transport`) and a mounted stream protocol (`p2pnet.StreamHandler`). In addition it provides a means of specifying relay nodes to listen/dial through.

TODO: the usage of p2pnet.StreamHandler is a little bit off, but it gets the point across.

```go
import (
  tpt "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-transport"
  p2phost "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-host"
  p2pnet "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-net"
  p2proto "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-protocol"
)

const ID p2proto.ID = "/ipfs/relay/circuit/0.1.0"

type CircuitRelay interface {
  tpt.Transport
  p2pnet.StreamHandler

  EnableRelaying(enabled bool)
}

fund NewCircuitRelay(h p2phost.Host)
```

## Implementation details

### Removing existing relay protocol in Go

Note that there is an existing swarm protocol colloqiually called relay.
It lives in the go-libp2p package and is named `/ipfs/relay/line/0.1.0`.

- Introduced in ipfs/go-ipfs#478 (28-Dec-2014).
- No changes except for ipfs/go-ipfs@de50b2156299829c000b8d2df493b4c46e3f24e9.
  - Changed to use multistream muxer.
- Shortcomings
  - No end-to-end encryption.
  - No rate limiting (DoS by resource exhaustion).
  - Doesn't verify src id in ReadHeader(), easy to fix.
- Capable of *accepting* connections, and *relaying* connections.
- Not capable of *connecting* via relaying.

Since the existing protocol is incomplete, insecure, and certainly not used, we can safely remove it.
